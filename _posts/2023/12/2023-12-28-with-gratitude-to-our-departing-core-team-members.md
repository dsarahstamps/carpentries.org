In the ever-changing landscape of the non-profit sector, we often find ourselves faced with unexpected challenges, like the [recently announced layoffs at The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/12/saying-farewell-to-seven-carpentries-core-team-members/). As we endeavor to turn adversity into opportunity, we offer tribute to the individuals leaving our Core Team and gratitude for their impact on our mission and community. Our path forward is shaped by each of their contributions.

## Dr. Alycia Crall
Alycia joined the Core Team as the Director of Community in July 2021 as a member of the Community Development Team. During her time at The Carpentries, Alycia has been a champion of our community and has led numerous community initiatives. Through programming, such as CarpentryCon @ Home in 2022, community-generated programming, Carpentries Gratitudes, and The Carpentries 25th Anniversary Celebration Series, and efforts like the organisation of the Community Development Team, localisation at The Carpentries, and the Carpentries Subcommunity Registry, Alycia has piloted the continuing sustainability of our subcommunities. Alycia's work at The Carpentries has given us a comprehensive community development strategic plan and a whole new programme of community sessions.

## Brynn Elliott
Brynn joined the Core Team in April 2022 as a member of the Community Development Team and the Workshop Administration Team. Through her role as Accessibility Manager, Brynn has taught us so much about improving our processes to make them accessible for all. Brynn led the Core Team and community to improve accessibility standards by adding and improving alt text to our lessons. She also made enhancements to the [Toolkit of Ideas](https://zenodo.org/records/10391883), and developed an [a11y statement] (https://carpentries.org/eia/) and an [accommodation request form] (https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/B2OSYaD0?typeform-source=carpentries.org). Because of Brynn, we are a team with a deeper understanding of accessibility. We will continue her work guided by the policy and systems she put in place for providing accommodations at workshops and other Carpentries events.

## Eli Chadwick
Eli started with The Carpentries community as an Instructor in 2021 and joined the Core Team in January 2023 as a member of the Technology Team. As The Carpentries Information Technology Developer, Eli led the AMY v4.2 release, which focused on changes to Instructor Training checkout. The update also included accessibility tests and an update to our color palette to meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements. Eli took a large role in supporting changes made in AMY for Instructor sign-ups and led the efforts to improve a11y of AMY. Without Eli, we would not have the features of AMY that make it so much easier for Instructors to sign up to teach workshops and for our administrators to manage those events. In the time that Eli has been on the Core Team, he has made a profound impact in creating more accessible systems for our community.

## Dr. Karen Word
Karen originally joined the Core Team part-time as the Deputy Director of Instructor Training in September 2017 and was promoted to Director of Instructor Training in January 2020. Through this role and as a member of the Instructor Training Team, Karen has been a huge advocate for the Trainer Community. Karen led the updates to the Instructor Training Curriculum in December 2018, which included adding Library Carpentry’s history and characteristics, new episodes highlighting classroom management and Instructor checkout, and a reorganisation of “Day 2” of the training. Karen was part of a task force that addressed the move to remote Carpentries workshops at the start of the pandemic, collaborated on assessment efforts to continuously improve the overall health and performance of The Carpentries, established Trainers Leadership to champion the interests and needs of the Trainer community, and led the initiative to change Instructor checkout in hopes of making the process less stressful and more accessible to all. Karen led a second large-scale curriculum update in 2021, with a notable effort to make the curriculum more useable and maintainable and to include goals for future updates. Without Karen's efforts, we would not have the strong Trainer community, a community with its own leadership, that we have today.

## Dr. Kelly Barnes
Kelly joined the Core Team in May 2020 as a part of the Instructor Training and Community Development teams. Kelly started as the Deputy Director of Instructor Training and was promoted to Director of Assessment in November 2022, where she developed a plan to use assessment to improve our programming, create measurable outcomes from our strategic plan, and streamline our assessment efforts. Kelly has been a source of support to the Instructor Trainer community, working both behind the scenes and forward facing, conducting and releasing the first [Instructor Training report]([https://carpentries.github.io/2021_IT_report/index.html) in 2021 and contributing heavily to the project leading the updates to the Instructor Training Checkout process. Kelly also designed the annual community survey and created the Theory of Change through her assessment work, which envelopes process improvement and alignment of The Carpentries mission, vision, and values to the outcomes we want to achieve.

## Talisha Sutton-Kennedy
Talisha joined the Core Team in November 2018 as the Administrative Support Specialist. Talisha has been a part of the Business, Instructor Training, and Workshop Administration teams and was promoted to Deputy Director of Business in January 2023. Talisha has had a huge role behind the scenes, doing administration for workshops, Instructor Training, and memberships. She has worked extensively with our fiscal sponsor, Community Initiatives, and took on leading the ongoing development of the new Carpentries website. Talisha has done a phenomenal job ensuring that the financial reports are prepared and delivered in an easily understandable way, and she created the budgeting workflow, a process for preparing and implementing annual, quarterly, and special event budgets.

## Dr. Zhian Kamvar
Zhian joined the Core Team in March 2020 as the Lesson Infrastructure Technology Developer. Zhian has had a role on both the Curriculum and Technology teams. As the Lesson Infrastructure Developer, Zhian has led many initiatives that make our processes more user-friendly and has greatly improved accessibility organisation-wide. In 2020, Zhian led an effort to make software installation easier by offering cloud instances as a backup for learners who are having difficulties and was a collaborator in the creation of [Glosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org/), an open-source multilingual glossary of data science terms. Zhian completed a total redesign of The Carpentries lesson websites, which has made our lesson infrastructure more intuitive, accessible, and easier to teach. Through his work, a huge milestone was reached in May 2023 when all 43 of The Carpentries official lessons were transitioned to the new lesson infrastructure, [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/08/celebrating-carpentries-workbench/). Zhian has made huge advances in the accessibility of our lesson infrastructure and created something that can support the community’s development and maintenance of lessons for years to come.

We have appreciated the countless e-mails, Slack messages, and words of encouragement from community members as we navigate this unprecedented transition at The Carpentries. These seven members of the Core Team have made a profound impact on The Carpentries, and although each leaves a legacy of their own, their absence will be greatly felt. Thank you, Alycia, Brynn, Eli, Karen, Kelly, Talisha, and Zhian, for every ounce of love and care you have put into your work and the community. We wish you all the best in your future endeavors.
